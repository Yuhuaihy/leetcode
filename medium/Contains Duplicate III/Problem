Given an array of integers, 
find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array 
such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.
Solution:
bucket sort
consider buckets, for n in nums, 
n/(t+1) defines different buckets
for numbers with absolute difference at most t, they belong to same bucket or neighbor buckets
using dictionary, d{b1:num,b2:num2}
if n/(t+1) in d keys, return true
if n/(t+1) +-1 in d keys, and n-d[]<= t, return true
To ensure the absolute difference between i and j is at most k, delete the first d when len(d)>k
